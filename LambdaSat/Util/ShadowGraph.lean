  LambdaSat — ShadowGraph: Lightweight Cost-Delta Tracking
  Fase 19 Subfase 2: Anti-explosion module for guided rewrite application.

  A ShadowGraph records the current minimum cost per e-class and allows
  efficient queries about whether a proposed rewrite would reduce cost.
  Used to skip unprofitable rule applications during saturation.

  Adapted from AmoLean (Discovery/ShadowGraph.lean).

  Key results:
  - `ShadowGraph.wouldImprove`: pure query for cost improvement
  - `filterProfitable`: keep only rule applications that reduce cost
  - `filterProfitable_subset`: every accepted application was in the original list
  - `filterProfitable_profitable`: every accepted application would improve cost
  - `updateStats_consistent`: accepted + skipped = proposed (invariant)
